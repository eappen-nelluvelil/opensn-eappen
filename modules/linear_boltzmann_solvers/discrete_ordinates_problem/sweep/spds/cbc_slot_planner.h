/**
 * Compute an exact minimum safe local-face slot assignment.
 *
 * For directed local faces A and B, define A < B when the consumer task of A strictly
 * precedes the producer task of B in the reduced task DAG. Faces in a chain of this
 * strict partial order have nonoverlapping lifetimes and may share one slot. By
 * Dilworth's theorem, the minimum number of chains in a partition equals the poset
 * width, which is the maximum number of pairwise incomparable faces.
 *
 * The planner obtains this minimum without materializing the face-poset transitive
 * closure. Its sparse flow network contains split task vertices. Unit-capacity source
 * and sink arcs identify predecessor and successor faces, whereas internal task-DAG arcs
 * have capacity at least the maximum possible flow. Because every capacity is integral,
 * the maximum flow is integral and is equivalent to a maximum matching in the implicit
 * face-reuse bipartite graph. Thus, if F is the number of directed local faces and M is
 * the maximum-flow value, the minimum slot count is F - M.
 *
 * Flow-network index limits or an internal flow-extraction/chain-consistency failure
 * return the conservative identity assignment, in which every face has its own slot.
 * The minimum is a slot count, not a minimum byte count for unequal face sizes.
 * Inputs must describe a valid reduced DAG in topological-rank order, with consistent
 * CSR offsets and face arrays grouped by producer. CBC_SPDS constructs these arrays;
 * the planner does not repeat their structural validation. Empty face input returns no slots.
 *
 * \param successor_rank_offsets CSR offsets for the reduced task DAG.
 * \param successor_ranks Task-DAG successors in topological-rank coordinates.
 * \param face_producer_ranks Producer task rank for each directed local face.
 * \param face_consumer_ranks Consumer task rank for each directed local face.
 * \param producer_face_offsets CSR offsets for faces grouped by producer task.
 * \param face_slot_ids Output slot assignment indexed by directed local-face ID.
 * \return The number of slots and whether the identity fallback was used.
 * \throws std::length_error If even identity face IDs cannot fit in uint32_t.
